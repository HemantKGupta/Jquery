// Concatenation
var foo = "hello";
var bar = "world";
 
console.log( foo + " " + bar ); // "hello world"

//Multiplication and division
2 * 3;
2 / 3;

//Incrementing and decrementing
//The pre-increment operator increments the operand before any further processing.
var i = 1;
console.log( ++i ); // 2 - because i was incremented before evaluation
console.log( i );   // 2

//The post-increment operator increments the operand after processing it.
var i = 1;
console.log( i++ ); // 1 - because i was evaluated to 1 and _then_ incremented
console.log( i );   // 2 - incremented after using it

//Addition vs. Concatenation
var foo = 1;
var bar = "2";
 
console.log( foo + bar ); // 12
