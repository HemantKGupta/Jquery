//With closures, functions have access to variables that were available in the scope 
//where the function was created. 

// Each function executed within the loop will reference
// the last value stored in i (5).
// This won't behave as we want it to - every 100 milliseconds, 5 will alert
for ( var i = 0; i < 5; i++ ) {
    setTimeout(function() {
        alert( i );
    }, i * 100 );
